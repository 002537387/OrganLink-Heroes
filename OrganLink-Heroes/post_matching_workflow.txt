Here's a detailed breakdown of the project's workflow after an organ match is made, based on my investigation:

**1. Organ Matching (Transplant Coordinator Role):**

*   **Action:** The Transplant Coordinator (`TransplantCoordinatorWorkAreaJPanel`) runs the organ matching algorithm (`EcoSystem.runOrganMatchingAlgorithm()`).
*   **Result:** The algorithm identifies potential `OrganMatch` objects based on compatible organ types and blood types between approved patients and donors. These matches are stored in `business.getMatchedRequests()`.
*   **Next Step:** The Transplant Coordinator views these match results in the `ViewMatchResultsJPanel`.
*   **"Select Match" Button:** In `ViewMatchResultsJPanel`, the Transplant Coordinator can select a specific `OrganMatch`.
    *   **Current Implementation (TODO):** Currently, selecting a match triggers a success message and sends a notification to the Case Manager. However, the direct mechanism to formally pass this selected `OrganMatch` to the Case Manager's workflow (e.g., by adding it to their work queue or updating a status that a Case Manager panel actively monitors) is a `TODO` in the code. This is a critical gap.

**2. Case Manager Role (Post-Match Coordination):**

*   **Access Point:** The Case Manager accesses the "Prepare Matched Order" functionality, likely from their `CaseManagerWorkAreaJPanel`, which leads to `PrepareOrderDetailsJPanel`.
*   **Data Source:** `PrepareOrderDetailsJPanel` populates its table directly from `system.getMatchedRequests()`, meaning it displays all matches found by the `EcoSystem`'s algorithm.
*   **Action:** The Case Manager reviews the displayed `OrganMatch`es. They select a specific `OrganMatch` from the table.
*   **"Process Order" Button:** When the Case Manager clicks "Process Order" (`btnProcessOrderActionPerformed`):
    *   The `OrganMatch`'s status is updated (e.g., to "Processed by Case Manager").
    *   A new `LogisticsRequest` is created, specifically tied to this `OrganMatch`.
    *   The `LogisticsRequest`'s status is set to `READY_FOR_TRANSPORT`.
    *   This `LogisticsRequest` is then added to the work queue of a `LogisticsOrganization`.
    *   A notification is sent to a `LogisticsOfficerRole` to alert them of the new transport request.
    *   The system state is saved (`dB4OUtil.storeSystem(system)`).

**3. Logistics Officer Role (Post-Case Manager Processing):**

*   After the Case Manager processes an `OrganMatch`, a `LogisticsRequest` is created and sent to the `LogisticsOrganization`.
*   A Logistics Officer would then handle this `LogisticsRequest` to coordinate the actual retrieval and transport of the organ.

**4. Lab Technician Role (Pre-Matching Focus):**

*   My investigation into `ManageLabTechnicianRequests.java` (the primary panel for Lab Technicians) indicates that their role is primarily focused on **pre-matching donor screening and testing**, especially for bone marrow.
*   This includes health checks (blood pressure, pulse) and HLA typing (Human Leukocyte Antigen) in `txtHLAList`.
*   They are responsible for verifying donor eligibility and processing/storing donated material (like bone marrow) *before* it's considered for a match.
*   The Lab Technician Role does **not** appear to be directly involved in the *post-matching* phase of general organ transplantation.

**In summary of the post-matching workflow:**

1.  **Organ Matching:** Performed by the **Transplant Coordinator**.
2.  **Match Review & Processing:** Handled by the **Case Manager**. This involves taking the identified `OrganMatch` and initiating the logistical steps.
3.  **Logistics Coordination:** Handled by the **Logistics Officer** after the Case Manager has processed the matched order.

**Answer to your direct question:**

After organ matching, the workflow **primarily goes to the Case Manager Role**. The Case Manager processes the matched order, which then initiates a request for the **Logistics Officer Role**. The **Lab Technician Role** is involved earlier in the process (pre-matching) for donor screening and testing.

**Critical Missing Link:** The "Select Match" action by the Transplant Coordinator currently only sends a notification. To fully automate the workflow, there needs to be an explicit mechanism (e.g., adding the selected `OrganMatch` to a Case Manager's work queue) to formally transfer the responsibility and data to the Case Manager's system.
